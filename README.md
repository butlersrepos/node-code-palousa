# Let's Make A Node Chat Server #

This repo follows along with a presentation intended to incrementally guide the user on setting up a basic node server with sockets and a functional chat room


### DISCLAIMERS - What this code is not
* this code is NOT optimized or test-driven
* this code attempts to avoid a lot DOM usage/manipulation to focus on sockets and underlying functionality
* this code is NOT clean, well-commented, or refactored. it is functional and hopefully explanatory
* this code solves these exercises in one way and does not pretend that there are not several viable, if not better, solutions for each part


### What is this repository for?

* learning a little bit of node
* creating socket-based node apps from Socket.IO
* follow along with my presentation
* get a feel for how one guy (Me) writes a sloppy, quick, Node app

### How do I get started? ###

* install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* I recommend [IntelliJ or Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) if you're into IDEs
* git clone this repo, maybe [install git](http://git-scm.com) first
* the readme.md in each exercise-XX directory explains your goal
* the solution-XX directories correspond to the exercise-XX ones and show you one way I solved the exercise (There are MANY acceptable solutions)
* each exercise after exercise-01 starts with the app found in the previous solution's folder
